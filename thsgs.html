    <h1>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE(AI)</h1>
    <h2>1. Fully Automated Driving and the Rollout of Robotaxis</h2>
    <div id="firstContainer" class="container">
        <p><b>The trend—and why it matters.</b> <button id='A' >Autonomous driving</button> technology continued to mature in 2020, with the industry’s leading companies testing driverless cars and opening up robotaxi services to the public in various cities. Fully automated driving, which enables rides without a human safety driver on board, will be necessary for the scalability and commercialization of autonomous driving.</p>
    </div.class>
    <h2><b>2. Applied Natural Language Processing</b></h2>
    <div.class="container">
        <p2><b>The trend—and why it matters.</b>In 2020,<button id="B">Natural Language</button>  systems became significantly more advanced at processing aspects of human language like sentiment and intent, generating language that aligns with human speaking and writing patterns, and even visual understanding, meaning the capability to express understanding about an image through language. These natural language models are powering more accurate search results and more sophisticated chatbots and virtual assistants, leading to better user experiences and creating value for businesses.</p2>
    </div>
    <h2><b>3. AI chips</b></h2>
    <div.class="container">
        <P3><b>AI hardware</b>continued to develop in 2020, with the launch of several AI chips customized for specialized tasks. While an ordinary processor is capable of supporting AI tasks, AI-specific processors are modified with particular systems that can optimize performance for tasks like <button id='b'>Deep Learning</button>. As AI applications become more widespread, any increase in performance or reduction in cost can unlock more value for companies that operate a wide network of data centers for commercial cloud services, and can facilitate the company’s internal operations.></P3>
    </div>
    <h2><b>4.AI BASED DRONES</b></h2>
    <div.class="container">
        <P5><b>AI-based drones</b> rely largely on <button id='k'>Computer Vision</button>. This technology enables drones to detect objects while flying and allows the analysis and recording of information on the ground. Computer vision works through high-performance, onboard image processing performed with a neural network.n 2014, two planes had gone missing with no luck at finding the wreckage. Lives were lost and families are left wondering “what happened?”. In the world of truly autonomous vehicles, UAVs should react on their own through some sort of external stimuli. It is through these external stimuli that the UAVs react and adjust their goal accordingly. These stimuli can be taken from various sensors on the craft but also can be given commands by a human.</P5>
